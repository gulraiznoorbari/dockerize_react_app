# Dockerized React App
## A Sample React App running in a Docker Container

Refer to the [Getting Started with Docker](./Docker_Intro/INTRO_TO_DOCKER.md) page for a detailed guide on how to get a app up and running in a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) container.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
